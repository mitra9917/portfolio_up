/* There is no problem with these Tailwind directives.
   The only thing to note: if Tailwind styles are not working,
   ensure that:
   1. Tailwind is installed and configured in your project.
   2. This file (globals.css) is imported in the main layout or _app file.
   3. The "content" array in your tailwind.config.js includes the correct paths.
   4. There are no build errors in the console.
